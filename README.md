# Game
An unfinished but functional game (for now with no purpose, just for learning experience) made with Godot that was created for KTU Program Systems Engineering module seminar.

Description for the game: 
Action takes place in a small world where you can climb up the platforms, some platforms constantly move. Be careful, this game has a reaper who haunts you while you are outside. Any contact with the reaper spawns you to your spawn point, so does falling into the water.
